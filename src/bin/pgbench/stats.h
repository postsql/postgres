	 * Transactions are counted depending on their execution and outcome.
	 * First a transaction may have started or not: skipped transactions occur
	 * under --rate and --latency-limit when the client is too late to execute
	 * them. Secondly, a started transaction may ultimately succeed or fail,
	 * possibly after some retries when --max-tries is not one. Thus
	 *
	 * the number of all transactions =
	 *   'skipped' (it was too late to execute them) +
	 *   'cnt' (the number of successful transactions) +
	 *   'failed' (the number of failed transactions).
	 *
	 * A successful transaction can have several unsuccessful tries before a
	 * successful run. Thus
	 *
	 * 'cnt' (the number of successful transactions) =
	 *   successfully retried transactions (they got a serialization or a
	 *                                      deadlock error(s), but were
	 *                                      successfully retried from the very
	 *                                      beginning) +
	 *   directly successful transactions (they were successfully completed on
	 *                                     the first try).
	 *
	 * 'failed' (the number of failed transactions) =
	 *   'serialization_failures' (they got a serialization error and were not
	 *                        successfully retried) +
	 *   'deadlock_failures' (they got a deadlock error and were not
	 *                        successfully retried) +
	 *   'other_sql_failures'  (they failed on the first try or after retries
	 *                        due to a SQL error other than serialization or
	 *                        deadlock; they are counted as a failed transaction
	 *                        only when --continue-on-error is specified).
	 *
	 * If the transaction was retried after a serialization or a deadlock
	 * error this does not guarantee that this retry was successful. Thus
	 *
	 * 'retries' (number of retries) =
	 *   number of retries in all retried transactions =
	 *   number of retries in (successfully retried transactions +
	 *                         failed transactions);
	 *
	 * 'retried' (number of all retried transactions) =
	 *   successfully retried transactions +
